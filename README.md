## Problem Analysis
- **Multiple Placement Data Tables:** There are several tables containing placement data, leading to potential inconsistencies and confusion in data management.
  
- **Missing Student Status:** None of the tables include the student status, which is essential for tracking placement outcomes.
  
- **Data Limitation by Academic Year:** Only data from the Academic Year 2023â€“2024 is available, as previous years do not include student status information.
  
- **Inconsistent Salary Data:** The Salary column contains non-standardized formats (e.g., '2 LPA - 3 LPA', '200000 - 300000', '20732 per month'), making it impossible to calculate an average CTC accurately.
  
- **Discrepancies in S3 and S4 Student Counts:** The student counts for S3 and S4 do not align with the figures maintained by the Placement Team.

- **Mismatch with Excel Data:** There are inconsistencies between the numbers in the dashboard and the Excel sheet maintained by trainers, as updates occur in both systems without synchronization.

## Solution 
- **Student Status Addition:** Anand added the student status to a table, but it currently only includes data for the Academic Year 2023-2024.
  
- **Placement Type Update:** Anand also included the Placement Type in the table as requested by the team.
  
- **Salary Data Standardization:** The salary data format issues remain unresolved, preventing accurate calculation of average CTC.
  
- **Data Synchronization:** To ensure consistent numbers, all updates must be made in a single location (i.e., the MIS). If existing data mismatches are corrected in the MIS, the dashboard will reflect accurate information.
  
- **Reporting:** A detailed report was provided to both the Placement Team and the Tech Team in two separate Google Sheets, with links shared for reference.
Dashboard Submission: The updated dashboard was submitted to the team for their review.


# Project 4: Skillplus EZY Attendance Data Analysis

**Dashboard:** *[Dashboard Link](https://analytics.zoho.in/open-view/286995000004503378)*

## Dashboard Requirements

    * **Engaged Cohort Count:** Actively engaged participants.
    * **Not Engaged Count:** Participants not engaged.
    * **Total Sessions:** Overall sessions conducted.
    * **Attendance Breakdown:** Counts for >95%, 91%-94%, 85%-90%, 81%-84%, and <80%.
    * **Duration Breakdown:** Counts for >120 min, 90-120 min, 60-90 min, and <60 min.
- ### Periodic Report:
    * **Number of Working Days:** Total working days.
    * **Engaged Cohort Count:** Engaged participants.
    * **Not Engaged Count:** Non-engaged participants.
    * **Total Sessions Count:** Sessions conducted.

    * **Interactive Filters:** Filter by date or cohort.
    * **Drill-Down Options:** Access detailed info.
    * **Automated Alerts:** Notify for engagement changes.
    * **Data Export:** Download reports for analysis.

## Problem Analysis
- **Closed Cohorts in Admission Table:** The admission table includes cohort names that have already been closed, complicating the total cohort count.
  
- **Data Filtering Issues:** When applying filters, the actual cohort count is also affected, leading to negative values for the not engaged count (calculated as Actual cohort - Engaged cohort).

- **Database Performance:** The large volume of data occasionally causes the database to go into standby mode when loading the dashboard, impacting performance and accessibility.

## Solution
- **Cohort Table Request:** I requested Sharad to create a separate table containing all cohort names, their status, and the associated programs. This will stabilize the actual cohort count even when using date filters.

- **Problem Resolution:** After discussions with Sharad, the issue was addressed; however, displaying the not engaged cohort count was concluded to be unfeasible without the cohort table.

- **Dashboard Submission:** The dashboard was completed and submitted to the team without the cohort table.

- **Summarized Attendance Table:** I asked Sharad about the possibility of creating a summarized attendance table and provided him with a sample format that includes the required columns. This approach aims to reduce the database load and prevent it from going into standby mode.
